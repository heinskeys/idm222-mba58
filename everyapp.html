            <h4>Introduction</h4>

            <p>Over the course of one term, we were tasked with redesigning an app with a focus on improving the user’s experience through micro-interactions. With instructor guidance, we rebranded, sketched, and developed a prototype user flow with unique interactions.</p>

            <p>For my project, I chose to redesign the Android app Loop: Habit Tracker.</p>

            <h4>Design Process</h4>

            <p>I began by first researching other popular habit tracker apps within the Google Play store. I wanted to see where Loop stood in comparison, but I also wanted to see where users were finding issues with these apps as well. From my research, habit tracker users' primary pain points were noted as:</p>

            <ol>
                <li class="listformat">Feature Bloat: Habit tracker apps don’t just track habits anymore. Some of the most popular apps like Fabulous Planner, Habitica, and Habit Tracker – Habit Diary, include extra features like gamification, journaling, task tracking, and even meditation. While some of the features can improve a user's experience, ability to stick to their habits, and even allow the user to simplify their productivity apps, for some users this immense amount of features can distract from their intended goal: to track their habits.</li>

                <li class="listformat">Lack of User Encouragement: Users want their habit app to make them feel accomplished for checking things off. When analyzing the user and IX flow of Loop, I noted that it lacks any positive and reinforcing micro-interactions. The app is functional, each gesture warrants the appropriate response, but there is no joy. For users utilizing Loop specifically, it can be difficult to feel motivated to continue to stick to your habits when you aren’t receiving positive in-app feedback for doing so.</li>

                <li class="listformat">Tracking/Habit Creation Inconsistencies: Creating different kinds of habits can involve different, complex processes that the user has to relearn each time.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>While the user base of productivity apps is wide and varied, there is a strong demographic noted in students and digital natives interested in things like technology and self-improvement. Many users have tried many different apps in the hopes of finding one that worked well within a large productivity system. I wanted this persona to reflect those users and their unique goals while also representing the differences in their demographics.</p>

            <h5>User Persona: John Dellucci</h5>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/Sitemap_WP.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>With this user in mind, I began rebranding the app and developing a new interface that would address his pain points.</p>

            <h5>Rebranding Loop</h5>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/Sitemap_WP.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>I kept the design of the app quite simple as I primarily wanted to focus on function and the development of my micro-interactions.</p>

            <p>While the design, flow, and intended user base were important factors in this project, our primary focus was the creation and implementation of various micro-interactions throughout the app. How can we develop, iterate upon, and display our ideas? What interactions would bring the most user joy without causing frustration over time? I was able to sketch draft several sketches that I thought could improve upon my users experience without causing issues down the line.</p>

            <p>Each of my final selected interactions were chosen in order to bring life to each interaction a user might have when going through the main user flow.</p>

            <h5>A Snapshot of my final micro-interaction sketches:</h5>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/Sitemap_WP.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>From there I developed an interaction flow, expounding upon these interactions and their greater function within the app.</p>

            <h5>IX Flow:</h5>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/Sitemap_WP.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>I used this as a guideline for my animation in After Effects where I created a rendition of my user flow and micro-interactions!</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>

            <h5>Deliverables</h5>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/Sitemap_WP.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <h5>Reflection</h5>

            <p>Overall, I am happy with the micro-interactions themselves! I enjoyed the process of focusing specifically on this one aspect of design, as I have a vested interested in the little ways we can change a user’s experience. Even just one small interaction can totally shift a user’s perspective, and I’d love to explore that more in future projects. I think my redesign of the app itself could definitely be improved upon; I think it leans a bit too far in the minimalist direction, but I enjoy the result nonetheless.</p>
