            <h5>Overview:</h5>

            <p>As a graphic designer for Drexel’s Campus Activities Board, the largest student-run organization on campus, I develop branding and graphics for our events across various social media platforms.</p>

            <h5>Gotham Escape Room, October 2023</h5>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/Sitemap_WP.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>This was created for a trip to Gotham Escape Room Philadelphia! With this graphic, I wanted to incorporate photographs of the different escape rooms! I was able to source some promotional imagery from the escape room company and proceeded to print and scan each of those images out on 11×17 paper. I then ripped each image to my liking and rescanned them into Photoshop to develop the graphic further! Scanning it in was a bit difficult so I didn’t get as much of the quality I was going for but I enjoyed the process!</p>

            <h5>Halloween Nights @ Eastern State Penitentiary, October 2023</h5>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/Sitemap_WP.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>For this event, a trip to the Eastern State Penitentiary during their Halloween festivities, I wanted to create a type-focused poster inspired by grunge-style graphic t-shirts! I had already been to the Penitentiary prior for a regular tour, and I was incredibly struck by the view you get of the cell hall when you stand atop the catwalk. I treated some promotional imagery focusing on these views, opting for a primarily black and white color scheme as I felt it allowed the text to pop the most!</p>

            <h5>Murder Mystery, October 2023</h5>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/Sitemap_WP.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Developed for a Murder Mystery event with a focus on inmates being used in the cure for the zombie apocalypse. I wanted to invoke the aesthetic of old hidden documents, like the viewer is uncovering secrets past! I took inspiration from police documents and old anatomy diaries. To add a personal touch, each of the “mugshots” is a picture of a friend of mine!</p>

            <h5>Six Flags Fright Fest, September 2023</h5>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/Sitemap_WP.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>For this poster, I focused on trying to strike a balance between representing horror and rollercoasters. In my research both of the event and for inspiration, I noted that a lot of promotional imagery focused solely more base horror imagery (i.e., actors, hay rides) without the inclusion of any of the rides. I wanted to gear my concept towards including both, while also experimenting with flatter, non-colored graphic styles. I decided to go for a collage-style graphic, including elements of the running attractions like the Saw X haunted house.</p>
