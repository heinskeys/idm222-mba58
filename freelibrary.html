            <h4>Introduction</h4>

            <p>Over the course of two terms, we were tasked with completely redesigning a website of our choosing. With instructor guidance, we developed interactive high-fidelity prototypes for a fully responsive website.</p>

            <p>For my project, I decided to focus on the Free Library of Philadelphia, the largest public library in the city.</p>

            <h4>Research</h4>

            <h5>Identifying Our User Demographic</h5>

            <p>When I was initially researching my target demographic, I came across two potential audiences: book-social-media users (teens – early 20’s; booktwt, booktok) and adults using the library as a resource for them and their children. Whereas book-social-media users were more likely to scarcely use the website’s broader features, as they were mainly focused on getting a library card, keeping up with new releases the library has, and any potential signings with popular authors — adults using the site as a resource seemed to be who the site was marketed towards.</p>

            <p>These adults tend to trend older than book-social-media users. They are more likely to have kids and would like to more greatly engage with the library’s different events, programs, and services. They are also looking to keep up to date with new releases but will rely more heavily on the events’ features. As such, I crafted my user persona to be more focused on this lens (while still keeping in mind how the site could suit both these user bases).</p>

            <h5>Developed Persona</h5>

            <p>Elizabeth Banner is an aspiring author seeking community. She is especially tuned into library events and services like writer’s workshops, industry talks, and other potential resources she could use to help further her career. She is a Digital Native, she knows how to use technology, and as such, prefers cleaner, sleeker, more streamlined websites that allow integrations and/or prioritize efficiency. Elizabeth wants to keep up to date with the latest releases as well as further educate herself.</p>

            <h5>Market and User Research</h5>

            <p>After identifying my user base I sought to better understand the site’s core issues, both in relation to other peer websites on the market and from the user base’s perspective. In this process, I narrowed down three major issues I thought the site faced:</p>

            <ol>
                <li class="listformat"> <strong>Outdated Design:</strong> The outdated design, while a trend with most public library systems, disadvantages them in regards to their target audience. Most users of the site — and as such within the target demographic — will have a preference for cleaner, modern designs as digital natives. It also puts them behind other MAJOR public library systems of their caliber, such as the New York Public Library which has a sleeker UI. A target user may be more inclined to explore other PA branches or even library systems outside of PA that offer out-of-state users opportunities (as well as commercial platforms).</li>

                <li class="listformat"><strong>Feature Clutter:</strong> The FLoP website suffers from a significant amount of clutter. This is something present in the design but also in the organizational structure of the website itself. For example, the blog page has a word cloud and a tag system attached that acts as another content search method. However, the word cloud is largely useless and serves no real function and there are far too many tags for the feature to be useful. This is something we notice across the site, with there being lots of options present but many of which don’t actually serve the user (i.e make things easier or simplified). Considering the target demographic is made up of digital natives, this excess of choice is likely to turn off the user as they are far more used to and inclined to use more organized websites. It also discourages users from exploring the site more, as well as actually looking into things they may be interested in since much of this information is buried behind tags, categories, and/or hidden in other pages.</li>

                <li class="listformat"><strong>Lack Of Visual Hierarchy:</strong> Unlike most websites, the Free Library of Philadelphia does not arrange its content in order of importance or to draw attention to important/special features. Instead, the homepage, and subsequent pages, follow an inconsistent layout and design. Heading size, content layout, color palette, font color (etc) all range heavily depending on which area of the site you are on. This is disadvantageous to both the user and the library. The target audience is less likely to be able to find the specific resources they are looking for, while the Library isn’t properly highlighting the resources/events/programs they intended to.</li>
            </ol>


            <h4>Design Process</h4>

            <h5>Site Map and Visual Identity Development</h5>

            <p>I conducted a round of user testing to determine the most optimal navigational layout for the site. My results were a bit unclear, with many of my user testers being confused about why certain navigational tabs existed at all, which made it difficult to sort them into categories.</p>

            <p>This informed me that I needed to severely simplify the site's information architecture, and I developed a new more streamlined site map:</p>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/Sitemap_WP.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>I also began drafting new branding and wireframes for the site, pushing forward in a minimalist direction (more in line with that of peer sites).</p>

            <p>For my typography, I paired Moderat, a variable geometric sans-serif that scaled well across the site, with Chamberi Super Display Italic, which I featured exclusively in the hero headlines.</p>

            <p>For my color palette, I wanted to go in a brighter, bolder direction in order to add more life to my minimalist redesign of the site. Much of the current website is made of lowly saturated reds, greys, oranges, greens, and blues, which felt outdated and mismatched. I thought blues, pinks, and purples both complemented each other and could represent a strong identity, especially for the hero illustration.</p>

            <h5>Visual Identity & Wireframes</h5>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/large/Identity_WP.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <h5>Prototypes – Term I</h5>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/large/Prototype_WP.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <h4>Starting Over</h4>

            <p>By the end of the first term I had developed a fully-fleshed concept for branding, identity and homepage of the Free Library of Philadelphia.</p>

            <p>I discarded much of it at the beginning of the next term. In speaking with my professor and doing my own reflection, I noted that my design fell flat and didn’t work to achieve my established goals (Modernize design, create clear hierarchy and highlight library services.) My hero illustration, for example, was too flat and didn’t feel completely relevant to the site itself. My color palette had merit, but every color felt desaturated on a site that was already dominated by greys and whites. The layout didn’t serve to utilize its negative space in a way that felt both well-designed and well-functional. Overall, it didn’t have the energy I wanted it do have.</p>

            <p>I spent much of the second term reworking my branding to not only feel more alive but to fall in line with my goals. This included updating the hero illustration, adding more saturation to my color palette and redesigning the sites layout to include more color and feature library information more clearly.</p>

            <p>For our second term, we were also tasked with fleshing out our user flow, and I chose to map out a potential user's experience in placing a book on hold.</p>

            <h5>Current User Flow</h5>

            <div class="articleImgFormat">
                <div class="imgFormat">
                    <img src="images/large/User-Flow_Full_WP.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>While the current process for this is functional, the overall layout of the site as well as the design suffers from the pre-established issues. For example, there is a lack of consistency across various aspects of each page within the flow. The login is quite notable for this as even if you are logged in, you will not appear as such on the homepage but will on every subsequent page. The catalog section is incredibly cluttered and as a user, it can be difficult to understand where and how to navigate in order to find the book you're looking to place on hold. This is coupled with more extensive navigational options like tags, word clouds, dropdowns (etc) which plague the entire site. I wanted to reduce the user's cognitive in my redesign of this flow, making it easier for them to recognize a process they’ve seen reflected across peer sites rather than recall the more complex flow presented here.</p>

            <p>I developed responsive prototypes for mobile, tablet and desktop experiences. Utilizing my analysis and reworked branding to design a new experience for the Free Library of Philadelphia.</p>

            <h5>Reflection</h5>

            <p>Overall, I am proud of the work I did for this site! It’s my favorite project to date, primarily because I feel like I learned so much from the experience. Having to restart my project in the second-term was an incredibly invaluable opportunity and it taught me a lot of the importance of letting go of our ideas and iterating for the good of the user! I hope to expand this project one day, revisiting some of the concepts I didn’t quite get to explore in my first go-round.</p>
